# The Data Engineering Cookbook
I get asked super often how to become a data engineer.
That's why I decided to start this cookbook with all the topics you need to look into.

It's not only useful for beginners, professionals will definitely like the case study section.

Here's the **download** shortcut: \

## How to use the cookbook
I split this cookbook into multiple parts
+ In part one you will learn the basics
+ Part two will contain a real world data engineering example
+ The third part contains over 30 case studies with links to interesting presentations

## How to contribute
If you have some cool links or topics for the cookbook, please become a contributor.
Pull the repo, add them and create a pull request.

Please pull only the newest release-x.x branch. \
This way we keep the master branch clean and I don't have to mess around resolving conflicts. You just need to change the .tex file. I'll recompile it later when I merge the branch with the master
